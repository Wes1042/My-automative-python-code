In order to understand what this is we first have to look at what Regex 
is...


regular expression, a regex is a string of text that allows you to create 
patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. Perl is a great 
example of a programming language that utilizes regular expressions

It is often used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word 
processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and 
AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex
capabilities either built-in or via libraries, as it has uses in many
situations.

this shows regex used in python 


This is used in google analyctics and to automate changing string to other inputs the user sets

                    Characters classes
\d Any numeric digit from 0 to 9.
\D Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0 to 9.
\w Any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character. (Think of this as
matching “word” characters.)
\W Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character.
\s Any space, tab, or newline character. (Think of this as matching “space”
characters.)
\S Any character that is not a space, tab, or newline
