Walk a directory tree and archive just files with certain extensions, such
as .txt or .py, and nothing else

my idea if how to do this:

Create a Regex that will find the files and save them in a variable
setup a Zip file format
specify which files you want with the regex setup
save ZIP file


Ill create my own custom program tmr
