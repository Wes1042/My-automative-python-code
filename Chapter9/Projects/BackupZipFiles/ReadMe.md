You’d like to keep different
versions, so you want the ZIP file’s filename to increment each time it is
made; for example, AlsPythonBook_1.zip, AlsPythonBook_2.zip,
AlsPythonBook_3.zip, and so on.


find the file/folder you want to backup 
create a file that will turn the folder to a zip file and rename it everytime
