The extension .pyw  will not display a terminal when being used 

this can be used as a program that retains values and can be called out 
examples :
mcb.pyw save spam ( the contents will be saved in the keyword spam)
mcb.pyw spam ( loads the copied contents of the value spam)
mcb.pyw list ( will list all of the keyword in the variable)

the sys module allows you to manipulate pythong run time program 
It would manipulate the programs functions not the system device
